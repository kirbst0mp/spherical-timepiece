# spherical-timepiece

## Purpose
To mimic a "Ball Clock" mechanism and to calculate how long it would take for a given number of balls to return to their starting positions.

## Operation

1. Navigate to the `cmd/clock/` directory
2. Run the `go run main.go` command
3. Follow the prompts

## Justification for the Solution
It is possible that this isn't the most time efficient way to solve the "Ball Clock Problem" in Go, but it was certainly fun to exercise my go routine/channel muscles!
